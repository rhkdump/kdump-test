kdump-test
----------

This is for RHEL/fedora kexec-tools test only!

1. This project is to provide a quick tool for testing if current kdump config
   is valid. To achieve this, a real kernel crash and dump will be performed,
   then a vmcore existence checking will proceed. Only if the vmcore with a
   special test id will be regarded as the success of kdump, which in return,
   indicating the validity of kdump config.

   Although this is a stand alone repo to maintain, it cannot work without
   kexec-tools, since it will source a few essential functions from kexec-tools.
   The purpose of such design, is to decouple kdump function implementation
   (kexec-tools) with kdump user experience(kdump-test).

2. To use kdump-test:
   1) Ensure kexec-tools is already installed.
   2) Clone kdump-test repo to a directory.
   3) Enter the directory and type command:
        $ ./kdump-test test
      It will trigger a real kernel crash and dump, so the system will be
      restarted. Please check if there is any unsaved work before doing this,
      and also schedule machine maintenance time if it will take a long time
      for the machine restart.
   4) After system reboot, type command:
        $ ./kdump-test test-check
      It will trigger the vmcore checking and report the checking result. This
      procedure will automatically mount remote/local drives based on the kdump
      config before vmcore checking.
   5) Check the result.
